				<h2>a handmade web.</h2>
				<p>When it comes down to graphic design, I believe that the most important aspect to it is the designers personality. As a viewer it should be important to identify the designer's personal unique style. I 100% agree with the statement about seeing through the website and who really is behind it? Not only websites, but many other types of design like visual identity, advertising, packaging, environmental, motion, art and illustration, etc. It really is refreshing to view something where you can identify that a human created those elements into their work. It really expresses their creativity. Personally, I really do believe thatâ€™s what graphic design is all about.</p>
