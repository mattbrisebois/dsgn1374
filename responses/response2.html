				<h3>the crystal goblet.</h3>
				<p>The main message of The Crystal Goblet, by Beatrice Warde is that typography has a lot more meaning and technicality rather than just simply adding text to projects. I personally enjoyed her example of this statement by using two goblets. The first being made of solid gold, with exquisite patterns, while the other being a simple crystal-clear glass. Connoisseur wine drinkers will prefer to drink out of the gold while more amateur wine drinkers will use the crystal-clear goblet. Those who prefer gold, put more importance in outward appearance rather than the wind inside of the goblet. Those who know little about wind or choose to profess to, will go for the crystal goblet. This metaphor is referring to the encouragement humble use of typography to serve the type rather than its vanity. Her main point is that the purpose of written type is meant to be properly processed rather than distraction. I really enjoyed this article because it really demonstrates a relationship between art and typographic designs, and a more meaningful way of expressing the importance of typography itself. </p>
